Task 1:
--------------------

* Theoretical part:

1\
git status:
this command used to know in details your status of your repo, the status
of file wether it was modified M, added A or un-tracked ??.
git init:
this command initialize a repo in your current direction.
git commit:
to add you changes and move it from staged to repo.
git push:
to push your files and modifications to Github and the remote repo.
2\
git add command put your files to staged phase where you can add more
modifications to your code without falling your source code with incompleted
code or modifications. staged phase letting you implement the code with the
added file but without any damage on your repo.
3\
a. GitLab, GitKraken
b. tracking code modifications to provide versions control VCS
c. True.
4\
it sets the difult as "git push origin main", so for the times after you 
write "git push -u origin main" you just can write "git push"

* Practical part:

1. ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "hazim.sh105@gmail.com"
to generate a keygen
2. press "Enter" to set the difult direction
3. press "Enter" for no password you need
4. starting SSH Agents and adding my Key using
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
5. adding the public key to github using 
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
6. then `from github go to:
a. setting ==> SSH and GPG keys
b. New SSH key 
c. paste the previos key 
CONGRADS your SSH Key is ready to use!
